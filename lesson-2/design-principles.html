        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li><a href="//www.dennys.com/menu" target="_blank">Dennys</a></li>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-09-23 184514.png" alt="Dennys Menu" height="300px" width="300px">
            <p> This is an example of Hick's law because there is one or more items you can choose from. It has a range of foods and it will take a while for you to make a desicion on what you want to get for yourself. Ergo this is the perfect example of hick's law beacsue of the amount of choices you have and how long it takes you to make a executive desicion.</p>
        </ul>

    <div id="visual-card">
        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/"></a>Netflix</li>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-09-23 190410.png" alt="Netlfix welcome screen" height="300px" width="300px">
            <p>This is an example of Visual Hierarchy. The reason why this is an example of Visual Hierarchy is because the consumer (aka us) are drawn to the biggest and most important thing whic is to sing up and get ready to use the servuices. Netflix wants us to see the big sign up sing first because they reallty want our business and wants us to use our money there. That is why the first thing you get hit by is the email address and get started.</p>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="thirds">
        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://oldnavy.gap.com/"></a>Old Navy</li>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-09-23 193019.png" alt="Old Navy Adevertisement" height="300px" width="300px">
            <p>This has many examples of the Rule of Thirds. Advertisment is one of the buggest users of rule of thrids because it is more appeasing to the eyes of the consumer. If there is to much symmetry it does not fulfill our need for differetiation. So the human mind crves something more and something unique.Old Nay has really nice examples of the rule of thirds in the pictures they use. Take the picture on the right with the two women and it will show with this rule I am trying to show.</p>
